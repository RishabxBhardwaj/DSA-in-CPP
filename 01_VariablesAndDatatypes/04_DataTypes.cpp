/*
  Types of Data Types in C++
    
    1) Primitive Data Types:

        Integer (int) (4 Bytes): Stores whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).

        Character (char) (1 Byte): Stores single characters (e.g., 'A', 'b'). Internally, it stores ASCII values.

        Boolean (bool) (1 Byte): Stores true or false.

        Floating-point (float) (4 Bytes): Stores decimal numbers with single precision (e.g., 3.14).

        Double (double) (8 Bytes): Stores decimal numbers with double precision (e.g., 2.71828).

        Void (void): Represents the absence of a type, typically used for functions that do not return a value.


    2) Derived Data Types:

        Array: A collection of elements of the same type (e.g., int arr[5]).

        Pointer: Stores the memory address of another variable (e.g., int* ptr).

        Reference: An alias for another variable (e.g., int& ref = var).

        Function: Functions are also considered data types in C++.


    3) User-defined Data Types:

        Structure (struct): A collection of variables of different data types (e.g., struct Person).

        Union (union): Similar to structures but shares memory between members.

        Enumeration (enum): A user-defined type consisting of named integral constants (e.g., enum Color {RED, GREEN, BLUE}).

        Class: A blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and functions (e.g., class Car).
